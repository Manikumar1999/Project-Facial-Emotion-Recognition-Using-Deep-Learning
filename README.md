# Project-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
Deep Learning for Facial Emotion Recognition
Overview
This project uses deep learning to classify emotions from facial images. The model was developed and trained on the FER-2013 dataset using fine-tuning and data augmentation techniques.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Manikumar1999/Project-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
Dataset
Source: FER-2013 dataset available on Kaggle.
Details: Low-resolution grayscale images categorized into seven emotions.
Usage
Open the notebook file:
Face_emotion_classification.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially for:
Data preprocessing
Model training
Performance evaluation
Key Results
VGG16: Achieved the highest accuracy of 58%.
ResNet50 & NASNet: Performance was limited by dataset size and quality.
Applications
Emotion-aware virtual assistants and chatbots.
Automated emotion detection in surveillance systems.
Limitations
Dataset complexity impacts fine-grained feature extraction.
Real-world application faces challenges like lighting variations and occlusions.
